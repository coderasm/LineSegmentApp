LineSegment:
Length)
Compute length of line segement using distance formula for
distance between end points.

Angle)
Compute angle by subtracting points. Then normalize resulting vector.
cosine theta is then x component of vector divided by normalized
magnitude. If y component is negative then subtract theta from 2pi.

AboveLine)
Plug x of point into point-slope formula of segment.
If y is greater than calculated y then point is above segment, else
point is on or below segment.

BelowLine)
Plug x of point into point-slope formula of segment.
If y is less than calculated y then point is below segment, else
point is on or above segment.

OnLeft)
If x coordinate of point is left of leftmost endpoint, then the point
is left of the segment.

OnRight)
If x coordinate of point is right of rightmost endpoint, then the point
is right of the segment.

Parallel)
If slopes are equal then the segments are parallel

MeetInMiddle)
If middpoints of each segment are the same point, then the segments meet
in the middle

MeetAtEnd)
Two segments meet at the end if the endpoint of one segment lies on the other
segment. Determine orientation of segements relative to each other using segment
slopes. If three endpoints are colinear, then check if endpoint of one segment
lies on other segment. If three points are colinear and an endpoint of one segment
lies on the other segment, then the segments meet at the end.

DoNotMeet)
If segments are parallel they do not intersect. Incompatible segment orientations or the
endpoint of one segment not lying on the other segment means the segments do not
intersect.
